## Sprint 2
Mostly just codebase setup, senior profile setup, setting up initial session scheduling functionality (but not implementing sessions just yet), senior browsing of companions and volunteers and profile viewing, companions and volunteers setting up availablility hours and other profile related things, and basic admin functionality. I grouped these user stories together below (see START GROUP), people who get a group with only 4 user stories have to do the SETUP task aswell (Note a group has 8 user stories but alot of these user stories are pretty equivalent or very close to equivalent which imo brings it down to 5 user stories). Also someone is going to get a headstart on implementing the map and map tracking functionality in this sprint, and someone is going to start implementing family functionality and that same person is going to implement searching functionality.
